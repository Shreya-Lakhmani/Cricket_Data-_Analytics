# Cricket_Data-_Analytics
I recently worked on a project where I used data to select the final Playing XI. Here's what I did step by step:

✅ Cleaned and prepared the data using Python (Pandas)

✅ Transformed the data using Power Query

✅ Built relationships and created useful formulas using DAX in Power BI

✅ Designed a dashboard in Power BI to explore player performance

✅ Looked at the dashboard insights to select the final 11 players

This helped me understand how data can improve decision-making in sports.
